# horiseon-accessibility-project

## Description
This is a refactoring project in which the object was to take a functional-enough webpage and improve the accessibility. For me, this involved taking a lot of divs and replacing them with semantic tags, adding alt attributes to the images and removing redundancies I found in the code. Specifically, I noticed a lot of HTML elements with separate classes that didn't really require separate classes since they received the same CSS modifications. The appearance of the webpage was not altered by me, but the code was refactored to make it easier for other developers to work with and to improve search engine optimization. This is was my first formal academic project and it taught me that there is more to optimizing one's code than just making it functional.

The only external resource I used was in regards to the boilerplate. The source for that is https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/basic-html5-template-boilerplate-code-example/.
